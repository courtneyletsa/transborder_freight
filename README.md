# transborder_freight

This project analyzes transborder freight movement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico from 2020 to 2024. The goal is to uncover patterns, operational inefficiencies, and environmental implications using historical transportation data. The analysis supports data-driven decisions to improve freight logistics and promote more sustainable practices across borders.


### Focus Areas for Analysis
1. Freight Movement Patterns
Examined cross-border trade volumes by year, mode of transport, and destination country

Analyzed seasonal trends and origin-destination flows

2. Operational Inefficiencies
Compared freight value vs. weight across modes

Identified potential logistical bottlenecks or imbalances

Investigated container usage efficiency

3. Environmental Impact
Assessed impact of high-emission transport modes

Explored how freight routes and modes influence sustainability

Offered insights on optimizing for greener logistics
