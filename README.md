# transborder_freight

![Transborder Freight Movement Image](transborder_freight_image.jpg)

This project analyzes transborder freight movement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico from 2020 to 2024. The goal is to uncover patterns, operational inefficiencies, and environmental implications using historical transportation data. The analysis supports data-driven decisions to improve freight logistics and promote more sustainable practices across borders.


### üîç Focus Areas for Analysis
1. Freight Movement Patterns: Examined cross-border trade volumes by year, mode of transport, and destination country. Analyzed seasonal trends and origin-destination flows

2. Operational Inefficiencies: Compared freight value vs. weight across modes, identified potential logistical bottlenecks or imbalances and investigated container usage efficiency

3. Environmental Impact: Assessed impact of high-emission transport modes, explored how freight routes and modes influence sustainability and offered insights on optimizing for greener logistics


### üìà Key Tools & Libraries
Below are the core tools and libraries used in this project, along with how they contribute to completing the analysis:

1. Python:
The primary programming language used for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Python‚Äôs flexibility and strong ecosystem make it ideal for data science projects.

2. Pandas:
Used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps with reading the CSV files, merging yearly datasets, handling missing values, renaming columns, and performing group-by operations.

3. Numpy:
Supports numerical operations and is used alongside pandas for handling arrays, computing statistical metrics, and improving performance during calculations.

4. Matplotlib:
A core plotting library used to create static visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs to illustrate freight movement trends and patterns.

5. Seaborn:
Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn is used for creating more advanced, aesthetically pleasing plots (like heatmaps or categorical plots) to highlight operational inefficiencies and environmental insights.

6. Jupyter Notebook:
An interactive development environment used to document the entire workflow, from data loading and cleaning to exploratory analysis and visual storytelling.
