# transborder_freight

This project analyzes transborder freight movement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico from 2020 to 2024. The goal is to uncover patterns, operational inefficiencies, and environmental implications using historical transportation data. The analysis supports data-driven decisions to improve freight logistics and promote more sustainable practices across borders.


### Focus Areas for Analysis
1. Freight Movement Patterns: Examined cross-border trade volumes by year, mode of transport, and destination country. Analyzed seasonal trends and origin-destination flows

2. Operational Inefficiencies: Compared freight value vs. weight across modes, identified potential logistical bottlenecks or imbalances and investigated container usage efficiency

3. Environmental Impact: Assessed impact of high-emission transport modes, explored how freight routes and modes influence sustainability and offered insights on optimizing for greener logistics
